# Yet Another Youtube DL Frontend

## What is this?

This is a very simple Youtube-DL frontend that I made, mostly for me.
It downloads videos via URL, or via a URL list. 
It will always download the highest possibly quality, and mux to mp4/webm/mkv (Whichever is the most appropriate format)
You can set the download directory (Defaults to your Downloads folder)

All files that this script makes are contained within %APPDATA%\ytdl


### Requirements
Python
ffmpeg (Same directory as this script, or in PATH)
